To Do
-----

- Use 'is_active' patch from bug 77193 instead of our own (as that's the one
  which went upstream) - but removes support for is_searchable, so emailed 
  bmo-admins to ask. (Remember to clean up is_searchable column)
  
- Fix additional bugs as filed in b.m.o.

- Make tests pass

- Write and execute test plan

After Release
-------------

There are several additional extensions people want:

- Update Splinter (code review extension) to work with 4.0 and turn it on
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=570786
  Security review: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578573
  Upstream Splinter hasn't changed for a year; will need to submit patches 
  back
  
- Update Securemail to work with 4.0
  Note: it has its own repo
  May also need security review...
  
- Pulse integration
