To Do
-----

- Upstream hook in template/en/default/index.html.tmpl

- Fix additional bugs as filed in b.m.o.

- Fix template/en/default/global/choose-product.html.tmpl to work better (and be a patch on top of the original)

- Fix Bugzilla Helper to suck a bit less

- Write and execute test plan

- make sure sanitizeme.pl still works

Bugs Fixed

After Release
-------------

There are several additional extensions people want:

- Update Splinter (code review extension) to work with 4.0 and turn it on
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=570786
  Security review: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578573
  Upstream Splinter hasn't changed for a year; will need to submit patches 
  back
  
- Update Securemail to work with 4.0
  Note: it has its own repo
  I've put in some (all?) of the hooks it will need; code which ties into some 
  of the custom hooks it uses in 3.6 can perhaps be rewritten to use new hooks
  in core.
  May also need security review...

Notes
-----

Patch has been applied from bug 77193 to make it possible to make versions, milestones and components inactive. This code is in 4.2 and so won't be needed for the next version upgrade. Also, the migration code in the install_update_db hook can go.
