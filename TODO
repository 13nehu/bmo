Before Release
--------------

- The "PR" bug filing form is just a copy of the base form; needs turning into 
  a proper custom template (and updating for e.g. groups URL API changes)

- Fix extensions/BMO/template/en/default/global/choose-product.html.tmpl to 
  work better (and be a patch on top of the original)

- Fix Bugzilla Helper to suck a bit less
  template/en/default/bug/create/create-guided.html.tmpl

- The "broken website" page is out of date (use input.mozilla.org, I think)

- Fix some of the additional bugs filed in b.m.o.
  (if we are doing a big testing cycle, we might as well take along a lot of
  other small tweaks and wanted changes)

- Execute test plan

- make sure sanitizeme.pl still works

Before or After Release
-----------------------

There are several additional extensions people want:

- Update Splinter (code review extension) to work with 4.0 and turn it on
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=570786
  Security review: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=578573
  Upstream Splinter hasn't changed for a year; will need to submit patches 
  back
  
- Update Securemail to work with 4.0
  Note: it has its own repo
  I've put in some (all?) of the hooks it will need; code which ties into some 
  of the custom hooks it uses in 3.6 can perhaps be rewritten to use new hooks
  in core.
  May also need security review...
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190945
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=484247
  
- Pulse integration
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=589322

- We could do with a version of sanitizeme that dumped out the 
  products/components/milestones/versions/groups etc. but none of the bug or 
  user data - so we can more easily replicate a bmo-like setup for testing.

Notes
-----

Patch has been applied from bug 77193 to make it possible to make versions, milestones and components inactive. This code is in 4.2 and so won't be needed for the next version upgrade. Also, the migration code in the install_update_db hook can go.
