  The problem is vaguely described with no steps to reproduce,
  or is a support request. The reporter should be directed to the
  product's support page for help diagnosing the issue. If there
  are only a few comments in the bug, it may be reopened only if
  the original reporter provides more info, or confirms someone
  else's steps to reproduce. If the bug is long, when enough info
  is provided a new bug should be filed and the original bug
  marked as a duplicate of it.
