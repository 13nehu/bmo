BMO Test Plan
-------------

Reading the code suggests the following operations need to be tested:

- Test additional text included by templates. Just read through the diff for 
  such occurrences and load the appropriate page.

- Making versions, components and milestones inactive and active again (and
  checking this stops them showing up in various places).
  
- Quicksearch for our status-related custom fields.

- config.cgi JSON output.

- Custom fields being visible or not visible in the appropriate products and 
  components, as defined in Data.pm
  
- Buglist sorting works fine, even for dates, severities etc.

- It's possible for even unprivileged users to file bugs into security groups.

- Bugs filed end up in the correct security group when the "secure" checkbox
  is checked.
  
- Security group gets emailed when bugs are a) filed in, b) added to and c) 
  removed from the relevant group.

- Bogus addresses like foo@bar.bugs don't get email, even if it's enabled in
  their preferences.

- Check that only members of the appropriate groups can set various fields, as
  defined in Data.pm.

- UUIDs, CVEs and SVN versions are correctly auto-linked.

- File bugs using the following specialist formats:
  - mktgevent
  - swag
  - brownbag
  - itrequest
  - legal
  - mozpr
  - poweredby
  - presentation
  - trademark
  
- Including loading them as e.g. http://site/form.itrequest

- Load page.cgi?id=upgrade-3.6.html and check for bzr output at the bottom.
