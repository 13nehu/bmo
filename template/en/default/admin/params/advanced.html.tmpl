  Enables the sending of the 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_Transport_Security">Strict-Transport-Security</a>
  header along with HTTP responses on SSL connections. This adds greater
  security to your SSL connections by forcing the browser to always
  access your domain over SSL and never accept an invalid certificate. 
  However, it should only be used if you have the <code>ssl_redirect</code>
  parameter turned on, Bugzilla is the only thing running
  on its domain (i.e., your <code>urlbase</code> is something like
  <code>http://bugzilla.example.com/</code>), and you never plan to disable
  the <code>ssl_redirect</code> parameter.
  <ul>
    <li>
      off - Don't send the Strict-Transport-Security header with requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      this_domain_only - Send the Strict-Transport-Security header with all
      requests, but only support it for the current domain.
    </li>
    <li>
      include_subdomains - Send the Strict-Transport-Security header along
      with the <code>includeSubDomains</code> flag, which will apply the
      security change to all subdomains. This is especially useful when
      combined with an <code>attachment_base</code> that exists as (a)
      subdomain(s) under the main Bugzilla domain.
