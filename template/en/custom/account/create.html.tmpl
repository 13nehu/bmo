      To create a [% terms.Bugzilla %] account, all you need to do is to enter a
      legitimate e-mail address. You will receive an email at this address to
      confirm the creation of your account. <b>You will not be able to log in
      until you receive the email.</b> If it doesn't arrive within a
      reasonable amount of time, you can contact the maintainer of
      this [% terms.Bugzilla %] installation at
      <a href="mailto:[% Param("maintainer") %]">[% Param("maintainer") %]</a>.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRIVACY NOTICE:</span> [% terms.Bugzilla %] is an
        open bug system. All activity on any bug you file will be visible to
        the public, including the email addresses of those involved. Although
        steps are taken to hide addresses from email harvesters, the spammers
        are continually getting better technology and it is almost guaranteed
        that the address you use with [% terms.Bugzilla %] will get spam.<br>

      <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> The folks who answer mail sent to the
      bugzilla-admin address are system administrators, they are not
      application developers, and will more than likely NOT be able to help
      you with technical issues that are not directly related to the [% terms.Bugzilla %]
      server itself.
      <strong>[% terms.Bug %] reports sent to this address will be ignored.</strong>
      If you need technical help with a Mozilla product, please
      see the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/support/">Support Page</a>.

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We recommend</span> using a free web
      email service (such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, or similar) and not your
      primary email address if this concerns you. There are solutions being
      worked on to allow you to hide your email address from other users, but
      that option is not yet available.
