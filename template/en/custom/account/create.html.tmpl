  Want to help us out by reporting a bug?  Great!  It's really simple to get
  started, just give us the email address you want to use.  Once we confirm
  that it works, your account will be active and you can start filing bugs
  and helping fix them.

  If you want, you can read our
  <a href="page.cgi?id=etiquette.html" target="_blank">bugzilla guidelines</a>
  (opens in a new window) while you wait.  Remember that bugzilla is a public
  place, so what you type here, and the email address you use, will be visible
  to others (including spammers).  Many people use an 
  <a href="http://email.about.com/od/freeemailreviews/tp/free_email.htm" target="_blank">alternate email address</a>
  for this reason.
